<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>
<p>
<a href = javascript:top.code.to_rkf()>We</a> are building a
library of formal representations of common actions, entities, and
modifiers to enable building knowledge bases efficiently.  The
components are implemented in 
<a href = javascript:top.code.to_km()>KM</a>, our
language for knowledge representation and automated reasoning.  Both
the Component Library and KM are protected by copyright, but are
distributed under the 
<a href=javascript:top.code.to_license()>Simplified BSD License</a>.
</p>

<p>
Most components have (or will have!) two descriptions:
<ul>
<li> The <b>specification</b> defines the component, gives its
relations and properties, shows examples and distinguishes the component
from "neighboring" concepts.

<li> The set of <b>axioms</b> for the component is a KM
representation that supports automated reasoning and
question-answering.  
</ul>
Use the radio buttons above to select the description you prefer.
</p>

<p>
Both the specifications and the axioms use a set of relations
that are defined in our slot
<a href = javascript:top.code.to_slot_dir()>dictionary</a>.
</p>

<!--
<p>
In the taxonomy displayed to the left, component names are 
<font color = "lime" > green <font color = "black"> 
when they have been released for general use.
Components displayed in
<font color = "red" > red <font color = "black"> 
have not yet been released.
Components displayed in 
<font color = "yellow" > yellow <font color = "black"> 
are not connected to our taxonomy, either because of some error or
because they are very preliminary.

<p>

Some of the terms in the taxonomy are from biology or course-of-action 
critiquing: the two application areas where we have applied our work so 
far. The display of these terms follows this color scheme: biology terms 
are displayed in  <font color = "magenta" > magenta <font color = "black">, 
and course-of-action terms are displayed in <font color = "blue"> blue. 
<font color = "black">
</p>
-->

<p>
The KM axioms for most components include "test-cases".  These test
cases are executed every day to ensure that errors have not crept into
the component library.
</p>

<!-- p>
There is also an <a href = javascript:top.code.to_comp_index()>index</a> of 
all components in the library.
</p -->

<p>
Building the Component Library is a long-term project, and we've only
just begun.  So, please visit us again to see what's new.  If you
would like to use the Component Library, or contribute to it (!),
please contact 
<a href = javascript:top.code.to_porter()>Bruce Porter</a>.
