<p>
The cornerstone of our approach to building Knowledge Systems is the
assembly of knowledge bases from reusable components.  Each component
represents an entity, event, role or property.  By instantiating and
combining these components, complex representations can be built
simply. 
For an overview of the approach, see our
<a href = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pclark/papers/aaai97.ps.Z>AAAI-97 paper</a> 
(<i>"Building Concept Representations from Reusable Components"</i>)
and our
<A HREF=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kbarker/papers/kcap01-content.pdf>K-Cap '01 paper</A>
(<i>"A Library of Generic Concepts for Composing Knowledge Bases"</i>).
</p>

Our inventory of general, domain-independent concepts is inspired by 
existing ontological and lexical resources, including:
<ul>
<li><a href = http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/> Wordnet</a>,
<li><a href = http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~framenet> FrameNet</a>,
<li><a href = http://verbs.colorado.edu/mpalmer/palmer/projects/verbnet.html> VerbNet</a>,
<li><a href =http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kbarker/working_notes/roget-actions.html>the headwords from Roget's Thesaurus</a>, 
<li><a href = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kbarker/working_notes/ldoce-vocab.html>the defining vocabulary</a> of the <i>Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English</i>, 
<li><a href = http://www.opencyc.org/>Open Cyc</a>,
<li>various ontologies from the <a href=http://www.semanticweb.org/>semantic web community</a>
</ul><p>

In the end, our component library will be well
integrated and cross-indexed with many other resources, and it will
add a level of detail and computational support that the others omit.
We envision that the component library will be a valuable
resource for projects in knowledge engineering, natural-language
processing, information retrieval, and machine learning.
</p>

<p>
Currently, we are representing each component in our formal language, 
<a href = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/km.html>KM</a>.
We are compiling a 
<a href= http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/tree/components/specs/slotdictionary.html>dictionary</a> of semantic
relations of five types:
<ul>
<li> relations between events, for example <i>causes</i> and <i> enables</i>
<li> relations between events and entities, for example <i>agent</i> and 
<i>instrument</i>
<li> relations between entities and events, for example <i>capability</i>
<li> relations between entities and entities, for example 
<i>contents</i> and <i>parts</i>
<li> properties of events and entities, for example <i>duration</i> and 
<i>size</i>
</ul>
These relations are based on Ken Barker's thorough analysis of case
roles, and other relations, in his 
<a href=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kbarker/thesis>dissertation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Our final step is writing the specifications and axioms for each
component.  For an event, the axioms include descriptions of the
entities that participate in the event, as well as the pre-conditions
and post-conditions of it.  The axioms are written in our <a href =
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/km.html>KM</a> language, so
they will enable KM to answer a wide range of questions, including
ones that require simulation.  
Follow the link labeled "Browse" (above) 
to see the specifications and axioms for all our current components.

The Component Library was the cornerstone of our success in the 
<a href= http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/projects/rkf.html>Rapid Knowledge Formation</a> (RKF) project, and played a contributing role in
the first phase of 
<a href= http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/projects/halo.html>Project Halo</a>.
