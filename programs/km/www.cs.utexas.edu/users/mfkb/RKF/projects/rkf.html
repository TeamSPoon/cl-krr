<p>
The goal of the DARPA-funded Rapid Knowledge Formation (RKF) project
(1999-2003) was to develop technology that enables people who are
untrained in AI to build knowledge bases efficiently and
accurately. This goal aligned perfectly with our research agenda,
which we're continuing to explore under <a href = http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/projects/halo.html>Project Halo</a>.

<p>
As part of the <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~rkf/">SRI team</a>
of researchers and engineers working on the RKF project, we developed
the <a href=http://www.ai.sri.com/project/SHAKEN>SHAKEN</a> system for
capturing domain knowledge from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). 

<p>
A SME builds a knowledge base using SHAKEN by creating and editing
concept maps. (Here's a good introduction to 
<a href=http://cmap.coginst.uwf.edu/info/>concept maps</a>.) The nodes
and relations in the map are drawn from our 
<a href=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/clib.html>
Component Library</a>, a comprehensive collection of 
general events and entities. 
We claim that relatively few components, perhaps a few thousand, are
sufficient for SMEs to assemble models of virtually any physical
mechanism or process. We claim that these components are independent
of domain, and that assembly from components instantiated to a domain
is a natural way for SMEs to create knowledge-base content.


<h3>Results</h3>

An independent group (<a href=http://www.iet.com>IET</a>) evaluated
SHAKEN, the Component Library and its associated claims. IET hired a
group of four biologists who were given a short course on using the
technology, then asked to independently build a Knowledge System
covering the content of one section of a college-level textbook on
cell biology. The Knowledge Systems were evaluated by posing a set of
questions, and the answers were judged by another biologist to be
"mostly correct" (see the first publication, below, for details).

These results are significant: they suggest that the basic machinery
works, providing a method for knowledge acquisition without the users
having to encode axioms directly (or even encounter terms like
"concept", "relation", "instance", "quantification", etc), and that
the axioms assembled from pre-built components support automated
reasoning and question answering.
