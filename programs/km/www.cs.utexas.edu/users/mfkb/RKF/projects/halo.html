	<h1>Project Halo</h1>
<p>
A project of the <a href=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/>
Knowledge Systems Group, UT-Austin</a>

<p>
The goal of Project Halo is to create a Digital Aristotle - a
Knowledge System capable of answering hard, novel questions and
solving advanced problems in a broad range of scientific disciplines.

<p>
Project Halo is sponsored and managed by Vulcan, Inc. Vulcan has a nice
<a href=http://www.projecthalo.com>website</a>
that describes the long-term goals of the project and
provides a browser for viewing the results of the first phase of the
Project ("the Pilot"). 

<p>
The Halo Pilot produced an important data point for the field of
knowledge systems. It proved that knowledge systems can be built
quickly, using off-the-shelf technologies, and they can perform very
well on novel, hard questions. 
<a href=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/projects/halo-pilot.html>Here's</a> what the Halo Pilot taught us. 

<p>
As part of the SRI team, we're now in 
<a href=http://www.projecthalo.com/halotempl.asp?cid=04&newsid=4>Phase II</a>
of Project Halo, which focuses on
developing and testing a suite of tools to enable Subject Matter
Experts (chemists, physicists and biologists, in particular) to build
knowledge systems unassisted by knowledge engineers. The goals are
closely aligned with those of DARPA's 
<a href=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/RKF/projects/rkf.html>Rapid Knowledge Formation</a>
project (2000-2004), in which we were key participants.
