This directory contains the Daydreamer and GATE programs as described
in the book:

Mueller, Erik T. (1990). Daydreaming in humans and machines: A
computer model of the stream of thought. Norwood, NJ: Ablex.

This code is subject to the LICENSE in this directory.

To run Daydreamer and GATE, start up a Common Lisp in this directory.

This code runs best compiled.
To compile GATE, do (load "gate_compile").
To compile Daydreamer, do (load "dd_compile").

Then, to run the LOVERS1 experience, a rationalization daydream, and a
revenge daydream, type (load "dd").

Alternatively:
To run a GATE test suite, do (load "gate_test").

To load GATE, do (load "gate_get").

To load Daydreamer, first load GATE and then do (load "dd_get"). Then
to run Daydreamer, type (daydreamer).

As of 2004-12-20, this has been tested under:
Allegro Common Lisp 6.2
Allegro Common Lisp 7.0
