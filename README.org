#+Title: Environment for knowledge representation, reasoning, and engineering.

Contains a transformation from SUO-KIF to TPTP-FOF.

You can read more about SUMO here: http://www.ontologyportal.org

You need to execute it with Allegro Common Lisp (`mlisp`).

See file `test-cases.tptp` for some sample test cases.

While there is already an implementation of a transformation from
SUO-KIF TPTP in Sigmakee (see link below), we felt that it would be
interesting to have a new implementation in Common Lisp that is
aligned to the essence of KIF, which has its roots in symbolic list
processing.

Another advantage of keeping everything in Common Lisp is better
integration with systems such as ACL2 and SNARK.
