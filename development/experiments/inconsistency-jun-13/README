While attempting to understand the proof found by Vampire and E (see
banana-slug-jun-13), we started to get suspicious of the proof there.
So we tried to prove $false and see what happens.  Vampire found a
proof in about 3 minutes, and this experiments was created to analyze
that proof (vampire.txt).

Found the issue, opened an issue to SUMO, copy here for convenience:

https://github.com/ontologyportal/sumo/issues/13

(instance eventPartlyLocated PartialValuedRelation)
(instance partlyLocated TotalValuedRelation)
(subrelation eventPartlyLocated partlyLocated)

following the same deductions in #7 we find that:

(instance eventPartlyLocated TotalValuedRelation)

but:

(partition Relation TotalValuedRelation PartialValuedRelation)

which, by way, of disjointDecomposition means that no relation can be
TotalValuedRelation and PartialValuedRelation.
