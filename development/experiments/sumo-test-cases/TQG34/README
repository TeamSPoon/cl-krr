E and Vampire didn't find proofs in over 20 minutes.

According to the documentation in Sigma:

TQG34.kif.tq: A KB integrity test: Every term is an instance of
              Entity.  Succeeds for local Vampire in five steps.

The most likely explanation for the current state of affairs is that
Vampire-KIF had arithmetic operations built-in, where as the current
E/Vampire ATPs don't.  A number of SUMO axioms need this.
