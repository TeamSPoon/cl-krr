Directories here contain experiments derived from the SUMO test cases
present at sumo/tests.  They were adapted to our conversion process,
and ran through the E and Vampire ATPs. 

How to execute provers (E and Vampire):

time nice E/PROVER/eprover -s --auto-schedule --proof-object --tptp3-format --delete-bad-limit=9048000000
time nice E/PROVER/eprover -s --auto --proof-object --tptp3-format --delete-bad-limit=9048000000
time nice E/PROVER/eprover -s --proof-object --tptp3-format --delete-bad-limit=9048000000
time nice Vampire---4.0/vampire --mode casc -m 20000 -t 6h

All the examples were generated with the core-sumo.kif in this
directory (which is merge+milo + some contradictions removed). 

;; example:
(compile-suo-kif :in-files '("core-sumo.kif" "reasoning.kif") :tptp t)
