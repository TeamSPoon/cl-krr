This is an analysis of the inconsistency of the output.tptp, generated

I only got proofs using Vampire.

Proof is a little more complicated than the May 23 one.  I also had to
manually replace strings like $splXXX to splXXX, otherwise IDV would
refuse to open the file.

Right away this predicate seems strange:

Original SUMO:

(<=> 
  (instance ?OBJ SelfConnectedObject)
  (forall (?PART1 ?PART2)
    (=> 
      (equal ?OBJ (MereologicalSumFn ?PART1 ?PART2))
      (connected ?PART1 ?PART2))))

Our translation:

/*
(forall (?OBJ)
 (forall (?PART1 ?PART2)
  (=> (and (instance ?PART2 Object) (instance ?PART1 Object))
   (<=> (instance ?OBJ SelfConnectedObject)
    (=> (equal ?OBJ (MereologicalSumFn ?PART1 ?PART2))
     (connected ?PART1 ?PART2))))))
*/

fof(a9724,axiom,(
    ! [OBJ,PART1,PART2] :
      ( ( s_instance(PART2,s_Object)
        & s_instance(PART1,s_Object) )
     => ( s_instance(OBJ,s_SelfConnectedObject)
      <=> ( OBJ = s_MereologicalSumFn(PART1,PART2)
         => s_connected(PART1,PART2) ) ) ) )).

Sigma translation:

fof(kb_SUMO_100,axiom,(
    ! [OBJ] :
      ( s_instance(OBJ,s_SelfConnectedObject)
    <=> ! [PART1,PART2] :
          ( ( s_instance(PART1,s_Object)
            & s_instance(PART2,s_Object) )
         => ( OBJ = s_MereologicalSumFn(PART1,PART2)
           => s_connected(PART1,PART2) ) ) ) )).

So, looks like our <=> prenex transform is wrong!
