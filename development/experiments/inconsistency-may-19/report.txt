The procedure is identical to the one use on May 18, so look at the
files on that directory for more details, especially report.txt

We have rerun E and Vampire and rerun IDV on the newly created proof
obtained from E.

Three axioms were used to obtain the proof:

[a1698]
(forall (?OBJ ?HOLE)
 (=>
  (=> (and (instance ?HOLE Hole) (instance ?OBJ SelfConnectedObject))
   (hole ?HOLE ?OBJ))
  (not (instance ?OBJ Hole))))

original from SUMO:

(=> 
  (hole ?HOLE ?OBJ)
  (not 
    (instance ?OBJ Hole)))

[a1699]
(forall (?HOLE)
 (<=> (instance ?HOLE Hole)
  (exists (?OBJ)
   (and (instance ?OBJ SelfConnectedObject)
        (=> (instance ?HOLE Hole) 
            (hole ?HOLE ?OBJ))))))

original from SUMO:
(<=> 
  (instance ?HOLE Hole)
  (exists (?OBJ)
    (hole ?HOLE ?OBJ)))

[a1719]
(forall (?S ?O ?TOP)
 (=>
  (and (=>
        (and (instance ?TOP SelfConnectedObject)
             (instance ?O SelfConnectedObject))
        (top ?TOP ?O))
       (=>
        (and (instance ?S SelfConnectedObject)
             (instance ?O SelfConnectedObject))
        (side ?S ?O)))
  (not (=> (and (instance ?TOP Entity) (instance ?S Entity))
        (equal ?TOP ?S)))))


original from SUMO:
(=>
  (and
    (top ?TOP ?O)
    (side ?S ?O))
  (not
    (equal ?TOP ?S)))

We create a TPTP, equivalences.tptp, stating that they are equivalent
and ran them through Vampire and E one at a time.

See the equivalences.tptp file for the results.

>> We run the TPTP under Mace4 to try to obtain a counter-example.

Since Vampire and E found that the TPTP translation (at least for the
first axiom above) are not equivalent, we want to use Mace4 to find a
counter-example.

To do that we selected the conjecture from equivalences.tptp marked
with [mace4] as a comment, and converted it to the Prover9 format,
using tptp_to_ladr (from the LADR-2009-11A) install directory of
Prover9/Mace4.
