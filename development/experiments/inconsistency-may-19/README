This documents the attempt at verifying the consitency of the TPTP
generated by our tool on May 19 after the implementation of issue #33
(missing instantiations) -- commit 70009d52.

The procedure is identical to the one use on May 18, so look at the
files on that directory for more details.

fragment-ibm.tptp: is just the three axioms selected by the proof, ran
through our conversion.  It is inconsistent.

fragment-sigma.tptp: is just the three axioms selected by the proof,
ran through Sigma.  It is consistent.

SUMO.tptp: Sigma's translation of Merge + Mid-Level-Ontology.

equivalences.tptp: combining the axioms from our TPTP transformation
and Sigma's to see if they are equivalente.

fragment.tptp: one of the conjectures from equivalences.tptp that was
found not equivalent, to be used in Mace4.

fragment-model.txt: Mace4 output from fragment.tptp
