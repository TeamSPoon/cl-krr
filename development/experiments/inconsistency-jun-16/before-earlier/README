Proof analysis:

(partition TimePosition TimeInterval TimePoint)

(=>
   (and
      (instance ?PREDICT Predicting)
      (patient ?PREDICT ?FORMULA))
   (exists (?TIME)
      (and
         (holdsDuring ?TIME ?FORMULA)
         (or
            (before ?TIME (WhenFn ?PREDICT))
            (earlier ?TIME (WhenFn ?PREDICT))))))

/*
(forall (?FORMULA ?PREDICT)
 (exists (?TIME)
  (and (and (instance ?TIME TimePoint) 
            (instance ?TIME TimeInterval))
       (=> (instance ?FORMULA Formula)
        (=>
         (and (instance ?PREDICT Predicting)
              (patient ?PREDICT ?FORMULA))
         (and (holdsDuring ?TIME ?FORMULA)
              (or (before ?TIME (WhenFn ?PREDICT))
                  (earlier ?TIME (WhenFn ?PREDICT)))))))))
*/
fof(a59460,axiom,! [FORMULA,PREDICT] : (? [TIME] : (((s_instance(TIME, s_TimePoint) & s_instance(TIME, s_TimeInterval)) & (s_instance(FORMULA, s_Formula) => ((s_instance(PREDICT, s_Predicting) & s_patient(PREDICT, FORMULA)) => (s_holdsDuring(TIME, FORMULA) & (s_before(TIME, s_WhenFn(PREDICT)) | s_earlier(TIME, s_WhenFn(PREDICT)))))))))).

The problem is the the relativization added a restriction:

(and (instance ?TIME TimePoint) 
     (instance ?TIME TimeInterval))

But TimePoint and TimeInterval are disjoint.

(domain holdsDuring 1 TimePosition)
(domain before 1 TimePoint)

This is the translation from Sigma:

fof(kb_SUMO_663,axiom,(( ( ! [V__FORMULA,V__PREDICT] : ((s__instance(V__FORMULA,s__Formula)) => ((s__instance(V__PREDICT,s__Predicting) & s__patient(V__PREDICT,V__FORMULA)) => (? [V__TIME] : (s__instance(V__TIME,s__TimeInterval) & s__instance(V__TIME,s__TimePoint) & (s__holdsDuring(V__TIME,V__FORMULA) & (s__before(V__TIME,s__WhenFn(V__PREDICT)) | s__earlier(V__TIME,s__WhenFn(V__PREDICT)))))))) ) ))).
