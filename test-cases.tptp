% These are fragments that can be used to test the transformation.
% They are based on the combined Merge.kif and Mid-Level-Ontology.kif
% axioms from SUMO.

% To execute these test cases, first, generate the TPTP conversion of
% these two files as follows:

% (in-package :suo-kif)
% (compile-suo-kif :in-files '("Merge.kif" "Mid-Level-Ontology.kif") :tptp t)
%
%
% Next, copy-and-paste each one of them at the end of the generated
% TPTP file and execute E as follows:

% eprover --proof-object --auto --tptp3-format --memory-limit=4000 output.tptp

% if a different invocation of E is required, it will be noted at the
% end of each test case
